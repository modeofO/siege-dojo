# Resource Nodes (Phase 1) — Design Spec

## Goal

Rename the 3 generic nodes to themed resource nodes (Forge, Quarry, Grove) and award persistent ERC-20 resource tokens for each round of node control. This is the foundation for the crafting/ability system in future phases.

## Node Definitions

| Index | Name | Resources | Theme |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| 0 | **Forge** | Iron + Linen | Military supply |
| 1 | **Quarry** | Stone + Wood | Construction |
| 2 | **Grove** | Ember + Seeds | Elemental |

## Resource Accumulation

After each round resolves, each player earns 1 of each resource token from nodes they control at the end of the round (after contests resolve, after traps trigger).

- Controlling Forge for 1 round = +1 Iron token, +1 Linen token
- Controlling all 3 nodes for 5 rounds = 30 total tokens (5 of each type)
- Resources are ERC-20 tokens — tradeable, transferable, visible in wallets

## ERC-20 Resource Tokens

6 separate ERC-20 token contracts, one per resource:

| Token | Symbol | Decimals |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Iron | IRON | 0 |
| Linen | LINEN | 0 |
| Stone | STONE | 0 |
| Wood | WOOD | 0 |
| Ember | EMBER | 0 |
| Seeds | SEEDS | 0 |

**Decimals = 0** — resources are whole units (you earn 1 Iron, not 0.001 Iron). This keeps it simple and matches the game logic.

### Token Deployment

Each token is a standard ERC-20 with a `minter` role. Only the `resolution_1v1` contract can mint tokens (it's the minter). No max supply cap — resources are earned through gameplay indefinitely.

### Implementation

Use OpenZeppelin's Cairo ERC-20 implementation (`openzeppelin::token::erc20`). Each token is a standalone contract deployed alongside the game contracts.

Alternatively, if Dojo's ERC-20 support is available, use that for consistency with the world namespace. Otherwise, standard Starknet ERC-20 contracts work fine — the resolution contract just needs to call `mint(player, amount)` on each token contract.

## Contract Changes

### `resolution_1v1.cairo`

After node contests resolve and trap damage is applied, mint resource tokens:

```
For each node n (0, 1, 2):
    Read post-contest NodeState for node n
    If owner == TeamA:
        Mint 1 of each resource token for node n to player_a
    If owner == TeamB:
        Mint 1 of each resource token for node n to player_b
```

Node-to-token mapping:
- Node 0 (Forge): mint 1 IRON + 1 LINEN to owner
- Node 1 (Quarry): mint 1 STONE + 1 WOOD to owner
- Node 2 (Grove): mint 1 EMBER + 1 SEEDS to owner

The player addresses come from `MatchState1v1.player_a` and `MatchState1v1.player_b`.

### New contracts: 6 ERC-20 token contracts

Deploy as part of the migration. The `resolution_1v1` contract needs the addresses of all 6 tokens to call `mint`. These can be stored as constants or in a configuration model.

## Frontend Changes

### Label Renames

Update everywhere nodes are displayed:

**`AllocationForm1v1.tsx`:**
- "Node 1" → "Forge (Iron + Linen)"
- "Node 2" → "Quarry (Stone + Wood)"
- "Node 3" → "Grove (Ember + Seeds)"

**Match page node display (`match-1v1/[id]/page.tsx`):**
- Node indicators: show name + resource icons
- Node ownership labels: "Forge: Yours" / "Quarry: Enemy" / "Grove: Neutral"

**Round history:**
- "Node 1 trapped" → "Forge trapped"
- Gate names unchanged (East Gate, West Gate, Underground)

### Resource Display

Show a resource counter on the match page — tokens earned this match so far. Can query ERC-20 balances directly or track locally based on node ownership history.

## What Does NOT Change

- Node contest mechanics (same spend-to-win)
- Trap mechanics (traps work on named nodes, same 5 damage)
- Budget system (base 10 + 1 per controlled node)
- Gate modifiers (unchanged)
- Gate labels (East Gate, West Gate, Underground stay the same)

## Future Design Notes

These items are OUT OF SCOPE for Phase 1 but should be kept in mind:

- **Phase 2: Crafting** — define 4-5 abilities with resource recipes. Crafting burns ERC-20 tokens (transfer to zero address or explicit burn). A new `PlayerAbilities` model or ERC-721 stores crafted abilities.
- **Phase 3: Ability NFTs** — abilities as ERC-721 NFTs. Equippable, tradeable, with art/metadata.
- **Round win rewards** — milestone system (win X rounds → earn a specific ability). Separate tracking model.
- **Ability usage in battle** — equip up to 3 per match. Contract changes for ability effects during resolution.
- **Ability art/metadata** — Loot-style generative or hand-crafted art. IPFS metadata.
- **Resource balancing** — may need to adjust yield rates (currently 1 per round per node) once crafting costs are defined.
- **Resource marketplace** — since they're ERC-20, players can trade on any Starknet DEX.
